Great — you're setting up for a **focused 30-day exploration**, and that’s the best way to test your genuine interest *without pressure*. Here's a **structured plan** to guide you daily over the next month, and advice on how to use that roadmap wisely:

---

## 🗺️ **Should You Read the Roadmap Fully?**

**No, not all of it — at least not now.**

Think of the roadmap at [roadmap.sh/game-developer](https://roadmap.sh/game-developer) as a **catalog** of all possible tools, skills, and topics. If you try to consume the whole thing now, you’ll get overwhelmed and feel like you're behind (you’re not).

Instead:

> **Skim it just once in Week 1.**
> Highlight a few areas that seem interesting (e.g., "Game Architecture", "2D Physics", "Networking") and bookmark them for later deeper dives.
